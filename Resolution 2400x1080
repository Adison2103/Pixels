### 3. Download ADB on your computer

 * Download ADB (platform-tools) to your computer:
    for [Windows](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip) |
    for [Mac](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-darwin.zip) |
    for [Linux](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-linux.zip)
    
 * Extract the downloaded zip file.

### 4. Navigate to inside of `platform-tools` folder that you extracted on  Windows Explorer or Finder(macOS)


### 5. Opening the command-line interface

#### For Windows: Open up CMD
  
 * Type `cmd` in the address bar and press enter.  This will open Windows Command Prompt.

#### For MacOS: Open up Terminal

 * Search `Terminal` from Launchpad and run it.

 * Run `sudo -s` and type your user password. **The terminal won't display how much characters you type, it'll remain blank.**

 * Run `export PATH=.:$PATH`

 **Without this, you will get `adb: command not found` errors.**


### 6. Connecting your phone to your computer

 * Your phone will prompt `Allow USB debugging` if it's the first time being connected on USB debugging mode.  Tap `OK`.

### 7. Actual granting of WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS permission to Pixels

 * When successfully connected, enter the following command and press enter. You can copy the command below.  If the command is executed properly, it will return blank.

 ```adb shell pm grant com.tribalfs.pixels android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS```

### 8. You may now disable the USB debugging settings

 * If you don't need USB debugging, it's recommended to disable it to avoid potential unwanted access.

 * Go to `Settings` > `Developer options`, scroll down a page and **disable** `USB debugging` option.

**That's it!**

You don't have to repeat this process unless you completely uninstall the app and reinstall it.
